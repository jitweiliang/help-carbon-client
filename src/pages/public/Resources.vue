                            Meeting the Paris Agreement's targets to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 is a daunting task for many companies. With mounting pressure to take immediate, meaningful steps to reduce carbon emissions, it can be challenging to know where to start. This blog provides a concise summary of the crucial steps that companies must take to establish a credible path towards achieving net zero emissions. From developing top-down 1.5°C targets to building decarbonisation pathways and securing support for effective execution, this guide will help your business navigate the decarbonisation journey with more clarity and confidence.

                            The first step in the decarbonisation journey is to set a baseline and measure emissions accurately. Companies must undertake a comprehensive emissions inventory, with a view of including all direct and indirect emissions across their value chain.
                            The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol is a globally recognised framework and accounting standard for measuring, reporting, and managing GHG emissions. It classifies GHG emissions into three types: Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. The latter are of particular importance, as they typically represent the majority of a company’s total GHG emissions.

                            After measuring emissions, the next step is to set science-based reference targets using a top-down analysis. This entails using a carbon budget approach as an objective way of determining the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming in line with the Paris Agreement, rather than being set by what is achievable by any one company. 
                            Investors and ratings agencies are becoming more discerning about corporate climate targets and plans, and how they align with the Paris Agreement goals. As an example, research-based indexes and analytics provider MSCI uses its Implied Temperature Rise methodology to evaluate the quality of corporate climate plans. 
                            Companies can get ahead of these external judgments by developing top-down reference targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C pathway. The Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi) offers guidance on how companies can set reduction targets that align with the best available science using base-year emissions measurement.
